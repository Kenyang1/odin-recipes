          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Dough</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In a small bowl, mix yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until frothy.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Knead the dough on a floured surface for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1–2 hours, or until doubled in size.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Make the Sauce</li>
            <ul>
              <li>In a small saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté for 1 minute.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10–15 minutes until slightly thickened.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Assemble the Pizza</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.
              </li>
              <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a baking sheet or pizza peel.
              </li>
              <li>Spread sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border. Sprinkle with cheese and add toppings of choice.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake for 10–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Let the pizza cool slightly before slicing and serving.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Eat the Pizza!!</li>
