      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In a small bowl, mix yeast and warm water. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until frothy.
          </li>
          <li>In a large bowl, combine warm milk, sugar, butter, egg, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and stir to combine.
          </li>
          <li>Gradually add flour, mixing until a soft dough forms.
          </li>
          <li>Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
          </li>
          <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Shape the Donuts</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out to about ½-inch thickness on a floured surface.
          </li>
          <li>Use a donut cutter or two round cutters (one larger for the outer circle and one smaller for the hole) to cut out the donuts.
          </li>
          <li>Place the cut donuts on a lightly floured baking sheet and let them rise for 30–45 minutes until puffy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fry the Donuts</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C).
          </li>
          <li>Carefully lower a few donuts into the hot oil, frying for 1–2 minutes on each side until golden brown.
          </li>
          <li>Remove the donuts with a slotted spoon and place them on a wire rack lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Glaze the Donuts 😏</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In a small bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla until smooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dip the warm donuts into the glaze, letting the excess drip off, and place them on a wire rack to set.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>EAT THE DONUTS!!</li>
      </ol>
