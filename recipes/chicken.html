      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Chicken is a versatile and protein-packed meat that can be prepared in countless delicious ways. Whether grilled, roasted, fried, or baked, it can be paired with a wide range of seasonings and sauces to create flavorful dishes. Chicken's mild flavor and tender texture make it a favorite in both simple and gourmet recipes, from classic comfort foods 
        like fried chicken to elegant dishes like roasted chicken with herbs. This recipe will guide you through making juicy, flavorful roasted chicken with 
        crispy skin and tender meat, a meal that's perfect for family dinners or special occasions.      </p>
        <p>
          Roasting chicken in the oven brings out its natural flavors and makes it wonderfully succulent. 
          With a simple seasoning blend and a hot oven, you’ll achieve a perfectly cooked chicken that can be served with a 
          variety of sides, from mashed potatoes to a fresh salad. This method allows for the chicken to be both juicy inside and golden 
          brown on the outside, making it an ideal dish for any occasion.

          <li>1 whole chicken (about 3-4 pounds)
          </li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil
          </li>
          <li>1 lemon, halved
          </li>
          <li>1 head garlic, halved horizontally
          </li>
          <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme
          </li>
          <li>1 tablespoon dried rosemary
          </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt
          </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon black pepper
          </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon paprika
          </li>
          <li>1 cup chicken broth
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Prepare the Chicekn</li>
          <ul>

            </li>
            <li>Pat the chicken dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This will help the skin become crispy when roasted.
            </li>
            <li>Season the inside of the chicken with salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary. Stuff the cavity with the halved lemon and garlic.
            </li>
            <li>Rub the outside of the chicken with olive oil, then sprinkle it with paprika, salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary.

            <li>
              Place the chicken on a roasting rack in a roasting pan or a large oven-safe dish. If you don’t have a rack, place the chicken directly in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the chicken broth into the bottom of the pan to keep the chicken moist while roasting.
            </li>
            <li>Roast the chicken for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) when measured at the thickest part of the thigh.
            </li>
            <li>Baste the chicken with its juices halfway through the cooking time for added moisture and flavor.
            </li>

          <li>
            Rest and Serve

            <li>Once the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10–15 minutes before carving.
